# V10_Dyson_BMS
A reworked unofficial firmware for Dyson V10 Battery Management Systems

THIS DOESNT WORK YET.

Current state of functionality:

Can accept charge and charge up the pack to appropriate level.
Will output power when trigger is pulled.
However, comms-pin functionality not yet implemented, without which it will not operate the V10 vacuum cleaner....

So, unless you want to have a go at developing it, don't try it yet!
